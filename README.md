Angular CRUD with Cancel Edit button 

Create a C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(estroy) interface for your single resource JSON api using Angular. Also, make sure that when you cancel your edit it shows the original value (don't just use a getAll()). Submit a PR and make sure to gitignore your bundle.

Add a presentation layer to your Bear application.

Add a CSS process to your Gulpfile including:
Minification
Concatenation
And a watch
Organize your CSS using the SMACSS file structure. I would like to see a proper separation of concerns.
base.css
layout.css
module.css
state.css
Your process should produce a single .min.css file into your build directory
Your application should be Responsive
Use a flexible layout
Use media queries where necessary

Additionally, organize your project in a way that makes sense. Use the file structure that mentioned in the reading as a guideline for building your own. Most importantly I would like to see modular code. Abstract your code into a separation of concerns between logic and presentation code.
